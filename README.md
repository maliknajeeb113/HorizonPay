### Campus Payment Solution

In many places people face a lot of problem while doing payments for things either due
to loss of connectivity while paying online or unavailability of hard cash. This might create
a problem for many people especially in campus areas where the jammers are also
installed. Thus, sometimes we have to cancel our payments which causes a loss not only
for the shops but also for us.

This project aims at solving this problem by introducing a complete virtual currency and
transfer platform that replaces the normal currency and money transfer platforms. The
platform will also have news system notifying users about various news encouraging
them to shift to this platform. This platform would work on local networks so there
would be no need of active internet. 

## Features
Once developed, the application will provide the following
- Register users and maintain a database with their required information
- Register Users along the necessary information.
- The admin can further add other users to the system.
- The Users can send each other money and credits and receive the same to do successful transactions.
